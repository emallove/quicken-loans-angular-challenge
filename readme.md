# Brand Marketing Code Test Purpose

This code test is designed to offer you a chance to show off your technical
capabilities in a real-world way. The challenge presented here represents a
cross-section of the type of work our team is typically accountable for at any
given moment.

## The Challenge

As a business that is highly dependent on maintaining great communication with
our clients, we would like for you to build a basic contact list page /app. In
it, you will need to pull data from an existing mock endpoint, render to the
page a table that displays all available information, and includes a mock form
with basic validation and submit button to add a new contact. As this would be
an internal app, it does not need to conform to any existing external brand
styles.

## Requirements

 - This page should be built out using Angular 7 or above.
 - This page should be fully responsive and mobile friendly.
 - The code for this should be saved to GitHub or similar service (GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
 - The table data should be dynamic and pull it's content from http://demo5838836.mockable.io/contact The form on the page should contain the following fields
 - First Name Last Name Company Email Phone Address
 - The form on the page should display an error should any of the fields be blank.
 - The form should display an error should it not adhere to a standard email format (i.e. username@domain.tld)
 - The form should display a message indicating success when the submit button is pressed and all fields pass validation. On successful submission, the page should serialize the inputs and post the output to console.log().

## Evaluation

Once you're happy with your work here, send the link to your repo to your recruiter. They will, in turn, pass that link on to the engineering team for review. From there, the team will evaluate the code based on the following:

 - Feature Completeness: Did the submission meet or exceed the listed requirements. 
 - Future proofing: How well will submitted code grow as needs change or evolve? 
 - Maintainability: How clean or well organized is the submitted code.
 - Code Quality: Does the code show a strong understanding of the technology? 
 - Creativity: Does the submission show novel solutions unique design decisions?

## Questions

Should you have any questions, issues, or comments regarding this test, please contact your recruiter and they'll be more than happy to help!
